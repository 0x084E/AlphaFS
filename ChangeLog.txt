Version 1.6

	* Unit Tests, also act as code samples.
    * Numerous bugfixes and optimizations.
    * The public key of AlphaFS.dll has changed, delay-signing is no longer used.
	* Complete implementation of .NET 4.5 File(Info) and Directory(Info) classes.
	* Complete implementation of .NET 4.5 DriveInfo() class and with UNC support.
	* Complete implementation of .NET 4.5 Path() class.
	* Implemented Unicode aka "Long Path" handling for all Win32 API functions that support it.
	* Class PathInfo() no longer exists.
	
	* New: Added support for NuGet.
	* New: Added support for building against .NET 4.0, 4.5, and 4.5.1 in addition to 3.5.
	* New: Supports networking: Enumerating Hosts, SMB share-/DFS information and connecting to network resources.
	* New: Supports working with Alternate Data Streams (NTFS ADS).
	* New: Supports working with files/directories with a trailing dot or space.

    
	
	* Mod: Class FileSystemInfo() has a couple of public read only properties:

		DirectoryInfo() / FileInfo()
			EntryInfo	 : Instance of the FileSystemEntryInfo() class;
			LongFullName : The full path of the file system object in Unicode (LongPath) format;
			Transaction  : Represents the KernelTransaction that was passed to the constructor;

		FileInfo()
			LengthStreams: Retrieves the actual number of bytes of disk storage used by all data streams (NTFS ADS).
		

    * Mod: Class Path();

		- some methods call their System.IO.Path counterpart.
		  These methods are not affected by MAX_PATH:

			Path.ChangeExtension()
			Path.GetExtension()
			Path.GetFileName()
			Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension()
		    Path.GetInvalidFileNameChars()
			Path.GetInvalidPathChars()
			Path.GetRandomFileName()
			Path.GetTempFileName()
			Path.GetTempPath()
			Path.HasExtension()
			Path.IsPathRooted()

    * New: Added static Class Filesystem.Device();

    * New: Added instance Class Filesystem.DeviceInfo();
    
    * New: Added static Class Filesystem.Shell32();
   
    * New: Added instance Class Filesystem.Shell32Info();

   * New: Added "Cached LazyLoading" to class: FileSystemInfo() improving performance for classes: DirectoryInfo() and FileInfo().


   * New: Added bool? isFullPath parameter to applicable methods of the File() and Directory() class.
			isFullPath is false by default.

			false (slow)   : Path is an absolute path. Unicode prefix is applied.
			true  (fast)   : Path will be checked and resolved to an absolute path. Unicode prefix is applied.
			null  (fastest): Path is already an absolute path with Unicode prefix. Use as is.

			Local "\\?\" or network "\\?\UNC" Unicode prefix is applied internally for all Win32 API functions that support it.
			
			The FileInfo() and DirectoryInfo() also benefit from isFullPath; AlphaFS adds an internal property: EntryInfo.LongFullPath
			which is always the Unicode absolute path of the file or directory.
