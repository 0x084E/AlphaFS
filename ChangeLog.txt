Version 1.6
    * Numerous bugfixes and optimizations;
    * Mod: Added more Unit Tests;
    * Mod: The public key of AlphaFS.dll has changed. (Delay-signing is no longer used);

    * Mod: Class File()/FileInfo();

    * Mod: Class Path();
        * Mod:  Changed 7 methods to use System.IO.Path since these methods are not affected by MAX_PATH:
                ChangeExtension(), GetExtension(), GetFileName(), GetFileNameWithoutExtension(), GetPathRoot(), HasExtension(), IsPathRooted();

    * New: Added instance Class Filesystem.DriveInfo();

    * New: Added static Class Filesystem.Device();

    * New: Added instance Class Filesystem.DeviceInfo();
    
    * New: Added static Class Filesystem.Shell32();
   
    * New: Added instance Class Filesystem.Shell32Info();

    * New: Added namespace & class AlphaFS.Network.Host

          Provides static methods to retrieve SMB Share- and DFS information from a local- or remote host.
          
         EnumerateDfsLinks();
         EnumerateDfsRoot();
         EnumerateDomainDfsRoot();
         EnumerateDrives();
         EnumerateOpenConnections();
         EnumerateOpenResources();
         EnumerateShares();
         GetDfsClientInformation();
         GetDfsInformation();
         GetHostShareFromPath();
         GetShareInformation();
         GetUncName();

      Provides static methods for connecting to network resources:
         
         ConnectDrive();
         ConnectTo();
         DisconnectDrive();
         DisconnectFrom();
         DriveConnection();

      Instance classes: OpenResourceInfo();


   * New: Added "Cached LazyLoading" to class: FileSystemInfo() improving performance for classes: DirectoryInfo() and FileInfo().

   * New: Added support to work with files/directories with a trailing dot or space.

   * New: Added support to work with Alternate Data Streams (NTFS ADS).

   * New: Added bool? isFullPath parameter to applicable methods of the File() and Directory() class.
			isFullPath is false by default.

			false (slow)   : GetFullPath() is called and a local or network Unicode (LongPath) prefix is applied.
			true  (fast)   : Prefix + use as is, path is already a full path, a local or UNC network (LongPath) prefix is applied.
			null  (fastest): Use as is, Full path with a local or network Unicode (LongPath) prefix.

			Local "\\?\" or network "\\?\UNC" Unicode (LongPaths) are applied internally for all Win32 API functions that support it.
			
			The FileInfo() and DirectoryInfo() also benefit from isFullPath; AlphaFS adds an internal property: LongFullPath
			which is always the full path of the file or directory in Unicode (LongPath) format.

   * New: Added support for building against .NET 4.0, 4.5, and 4.5.1 in addition to 3.5.

   * New: Added support for NuGet.

         function with the FileInformationClass set to FileIdBothDirectoryInfo.
  * New: Directory.CountFiles
  * Mod: Additional overloads for File.Open method.
  * Mod: FileAttributes.Invalid flag removed.
  * New: Directory.GetProperties method for retrieving aggregated information about files in a directory.
